abstract:
- content: This specification describes contains how the definition of the UMTS system
    will be achieved in a phased approach. This document also specifies the requirements
    for release 99 of UMTS. Some requirements which are necessary to ensure a smooth
    transition to later releases are also indicated. This document should, however,
    be read in conjunction with the other 22.000 series documents which provide a
    complete description of the requirements for UMTS release 1999 and beyond.
