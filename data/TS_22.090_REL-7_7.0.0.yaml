abstract:
- content: "There are two modes of USSD: MMI-mode and application mode. MMI-mode USSD
    is for the transparent transport of MMI strings entered by the user to the network
    and for the transparent transport of text strings from the network that are displayed
    by the mobile for user information.\r\nApplication mode USSD is for the transparent
    transport of data between the network and the mobile station. Application mode
    USSD is intended to be used by applications in the network and their peer applications
    in the UE.\r\nThe communication over the radio interface takes place on the signalling
    channels using short dialogues with peak data throughput rate capabilities of
    up to approximately 600 bits/s outside of a call and 1 000 bits/s during a call."
