abstract:
- content: This specification describes the characteristics of the Layer 1 transport
    channels and physical channel in the TDD mode of UTRA. The main objectives of
    the document are to be a part of the full description of the UTRA Layer 1, and
    to serve as a basis for the drafting of the actual technical specification (TS).
