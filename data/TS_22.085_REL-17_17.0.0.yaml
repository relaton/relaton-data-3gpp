abstract:
- content: The CUG supplementary service enables subscribers, connected to a network
    and possibly also other networks, to form CUGs to and from which access is restricted.
    A specific user may be a member of one or more CUGs. Members of a specific CUG
    can communicate among each other but not, in general, with users outside the group.
