abstract:
- content: CD enables the served mobile subscriber to respond to an incoming call
    offered by the network by requesting redirection of this call to another number
    specified in the response. The CD supplementary service can only be invoked before
    the connection is established by the served mobile subscriber, i.e. in response
    to the offered call, or during the period that the served subscriber is being
    informed of the call. The served subscriberâ€™s ability to originate calls is unaffected
    by the CD supplementary service.
