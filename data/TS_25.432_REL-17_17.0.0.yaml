abstract:
- content: This specification describes the signalling transport related to the Node
    B application part (NBAP) signalling to be used across the Iub interface. The
    Iub interface is a logical interface for the interconnection of Node B and RNC
    components of the UTRAN. The RNC signalling between these nodes is based on NBAP.
