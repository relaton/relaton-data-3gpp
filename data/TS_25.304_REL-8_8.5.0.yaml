abstract:
- content: "This specification describes the overall idle mode process for the UE
    and the functional division between the non-access stratum and access stratum
    in the UE. The UE is in idle mode when the connection of the UE is closed on all
    layers, e.g. there is neither an MM connection nor an RRC connection.\r\nThis
    specification presents also examples of inter-layer procedures related to the
    idle mode processes and describes idle mode functionality of a dual mode UMTS/GSM
    UE."
